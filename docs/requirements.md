Requirements
===============
Must Have

- Users can view currently listed BUY and SELL offers.
- Users trade using the credit balance and assets of their organisational unit.
- The IT administration team can (within the GUI) add new organisational units, asset types and users (including assign their password, organisational unit, and access level i.e., standard or administrator). They can also edit an organisational unit’s number of credits, number of assets etc.

Should Have
---------------
- Users have their own individual usernames and passwords.
- Users can remove currently listed offers from their organisational unit.
- The system prevents the listing of offers that would put an organisational unit into debt, i.e., BUY offers or SELL offers that exceed the organisational unit’s number of credits or number of assets.
